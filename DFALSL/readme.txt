The codes implement the optimization procedure for the model proposed in Dual-level Feature Assessment for Unsupervised Multi-view Feature Selection with Latent Space Learning. Welcome to use our model as one of the baselines in your paper. If you have any questions, you are welcome to send email to me (jianshengwu@ncu.edu.cn). 

To use the codes, you must first run start_spams.m on the Linux platform to install the package spams (Online learning for matrix factorization and sparse coding), which is used to initialize the latent representations. 

It is important to note that the model is evaluated using Matlab 2020b.
